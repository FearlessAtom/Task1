The quaint village of Willowbrook is famous for its annual "Giant Pumpkin Festival." Each year, residents and visitors gather to admire enormous pumpkins, some the size of small cars, and engage in pumpkin-themed contests like pumpkin pie-eating and pumpkin carving. It's a celebration of all things orange and gourd-like.
